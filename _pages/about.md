Work Experience/Internships
-----
  * Software Engineer, Qualcomm (July 2019 - Present)
       * Working on fixing bugs and feature requests in NAS layer of 4G and 5G.
       * Classification of logs using logistic regression, RNN and Random forest for automation of classification.
  * Intern, Flipkart (Jan 2019 - June 2019)
       * Project on churn prediction and checkout drivers using different ML algorithms and preprocessing techniques..
       * Changes due to checkout project lead to a change in UI in flipkart app and the score generated through churn prediction is tracked a metric. It will be used to treat customers different if they are likely to churn.
  * Data science intern, The Level (May 2018-December 2018)
       * Different projects based on Machine Learning and Data Mining as mentioned below.
       * Got first hand experience about real life problems which can be solved using Machine Learning.
  * Summer Intern, Bhushan Steels Limited, Ghaziabad (May 2017-July 2017)
       * The project was to draw the Single Line Diagram for H&T department in Bhushan steels.
       * Required visiting all the sub departments and gaining good knowledge of their working.


Projects
------
  * Customer Churn Prediction ( Flipkart)
        * Classification of customers into three classes based on their transactions in a calendar year.
        * Data contained more than 100 variables and about 40 million different transactions hence a lot of preprocessing.
        * Used  XGBoost, random forest and LR in boosting ensemble to achieve an accuracy for 78% on 3 class predictors.
  * Checkout Conversion Drivers ( Flipkart)
        * Predict drivers leading to a successful checkout by a customer and their impact on conversion.
        * Used Adobe analytics and Sql queries to aggregate the data of flipkart customers.
        * Used Gradient boosting and Random forest to find feature importance and predict customer conversion.
  * Post Classifier (The Level)
        * Built a topic classifier with the purpose of tagging posts written by users on their news feed.
        * Used Multi-class SVM to classify the topic into relevant topics.
        * Built on reddit posts of the topic as true points coupled with proper noun tagging using spacy library.
        * Achieved an accuracy of 96.3% on dev set making the model ready for live testing.
  * Rate Models (The Level)
        * Built rate models to predict car insurance rates of insurance companies like GEICO.
        * Initial weights of all variables (like car price and age) were gathered from rate filings of insurance companies.
        * Built a similarity score generator using clustering to validate the rate models.
  * Car Price Predictor (The Level)
        * Predicted car price using year, make, model and mileage of the car.
        * Used Gradient Boosting Decision Trees to train the model using  the kaggle 1.2 million car price dataset.
  * Financial Signal Processing
        * Time series analysis using Kalman Filters, SVM and Recursive neural networks.
        * Achieved an accuracy of over 95% using open source NYSE data.
  * Movie review text classification (Word sentiment analysis)
        * The movie reviews(Large movie review dataset IMDB) are classified as good or bad using word level features.
        * Used SVM and Naive Bayes to classify the reviews.
  * Image classification
        * Classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Deep Convolutional Networks.
        * Used the TensorFlow library in Python to build the network and fine tuned the final layers.
